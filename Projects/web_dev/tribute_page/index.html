            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Attends the University of Minnesota thanks to a government program called "National Youth Administration" </li>
            <li><strong>1935</strong> - Takes a break from school to earn some money, ends up in the Civilian Convervation Corps helping impoverished americans.  "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me." </li>
            <li><strong>1937</strong> - Starts working at the US Forestry Service after graduating university </li>
            <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries Margret Gibson, his wife of 69 years.  Laid off due to budget cuts, he decides to return to school to study under Elvin Charles Stakman where he learns about pest-resistance plants </li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - He is rejected from the military after the Pearl Harbour attacks.  Military then asks his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science </li>
            <li><strong>1942</strong> - Earns a Ph.D in Genetics and Plant Pathology </li>
            <li><strong>1944</strong> - Leaves behind the comfortable life to lead a new plant pathology program in Mexico.  This program ends up producing over 6000 strains of disease and climate resistant wheat over the next 16 years </li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers how to double the wheat production by growing it twice per season </li>
            <li><strong>1953</strong> - Creates a strain that ultimately provides 95% of Mexico's wheat  by cross breeding </li>
            <li><strong>1962</strong> - Takes his innovations to India to curb mass starvation </li>
            <li><strong>1970</strong> -  Receives Nobel Peace Prize </li>
            <li><strong>1983</strong> - Increased the maize and sorghum yields in seven African countries </li>
            <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>
            <li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds." </li>
            <li><strong>2009</strong> - Dies at the age of 95 </li>
